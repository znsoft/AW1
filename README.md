Introduction
============

Project for generating Yin Yang -symbol as an Android Livepaper. Plus making it
somewhat dynamical using OpenGL ES 2.0 shaders for rendering it on screen.
There are some somewhat 'uglyish' hacks involved, e.g renderer interface is implemented
directly into GLSurfaceView, which isn't the best option if similarly named methods
are introduced to base class one day. But this way some newly introduced internal classes
can be reduced.

Beyond this, screensaver should comply with regular expectations one could have for
any screensaver. Application icon and screensaver thumbnail share the same image for
size reasons (goal is to produce as tiny .apk file as possible). Not to forget while
making rendering as dynamic as possible - it comes along with the good news file
size tends to drop significantly. Without the need to worry about differently sized
screens as there ought to be pixel correct output always.

That said, hope you enjoy this tiny Yin Yang live wallpaper for Android devices.
